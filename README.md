# Simply-Love-Harness-Module

A theme module for ITGmania Simply Love that makes the game's song select and menu controls act like a client to be controlled by python.

**Features:**

* Report current screen and general status
* Provide a song list
* Supported commands: start song, pause/resume, stop

PyQt and Flask demos are provided, they both have the same features with different UI examples.

## Install

1. Get RemoteWsHarness.lua from [https://github.com/thatdecade/ITGmania-Remote-Control-Tests](https://github.com/thatdecade/ITGmania-Remote-Control-Tests)'s' WebSockets test code and copy it to `ITGmania\Themes\Simply Love\Modules\RemoteWsHarness.lua`

3. Launch ITGmania, choose the Simply Love theme and navigate to song select.

4. Start the demo python.

**Notes:** If songs do not appear in python, navigate ITGmania to the song select screen and join P1.
